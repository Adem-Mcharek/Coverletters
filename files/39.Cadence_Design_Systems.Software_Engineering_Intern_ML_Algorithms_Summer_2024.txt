Desired Qualifications Experience in automatic design optimization for thermal targets
---------------------- 
At Cadence, we hire and develop leaders and innovators who want to make an impact on the world of technology. This internship will focus on using machine learning algorithms in thermal optimization application. You will have the opportunity to help design, develop, troubleshoot and debug P C B/package/chip thermal analysis software. Works on extremely complex problems where analysis of situations or data requires an evaluation of intangible variance factors. Exercises independent judgment in developing methods, techniques, and evaluation criterion for obtaining results. Work leadership may be provided by assigning work and resolving problems. Position Requirements: Currently pursuing a B S, in M E/ E E/ C S or other related engineering discipline, have strong programming skills in C++, and deep familiarity with object-oriented programming methods. Prior knowledge and experience with distributed/multi-threaded programming, numerical analysis techniques, meshing techniques, finite-element based thermal simulation, C F D analysis, and in-depth understanding of electric cooling of P C B/package/chip preferred. Experience on automatic design optimization for thermal targets is a plus. We’re doing work that matters. Help us solve what others can’t.
