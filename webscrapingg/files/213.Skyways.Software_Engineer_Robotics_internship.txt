At Skyways we are building a new form of air transportation. Some people call it the flying car. We believe fully autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles represent a unique opportunity to move things and ultimately people in new, more efficient ways. Our strategy to get there is completely different from the rest of the industry. Skyways is a startup based in Austin, T X. We are backed by some of the most respected investors in Silicon Valley including Y Combinator. Although we consider ourselves early-stage, we already have vehicles in production and in the hands of paying customers (see here and here). Come join us and work on a transportation revolution to advance our civilization!
