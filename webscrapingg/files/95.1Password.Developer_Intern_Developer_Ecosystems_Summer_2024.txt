Our vision is to create a safer, simpler digital future for everyone, and our culture values simplicity, honesty and a human-centric approach to solving problems. Come help us unlock peace of mind so everyone can stay safer online. Software powers the world, and we empower those who write it. We are on a mission to make worldwide developers’ daily lives easier and more secure. We do that by building tools that eliminate accepted complexity, turning historically complex, confusing, and frustrating tasks into delightful automated processes. This makes developers more productive and protects businesses throughout the entire software development lifecycle: from writing and committing code to testing in C I, deploying, and finally running in production. Remote by design. 1 Password has been remote-first since our inception in 2005, meaning that we’re no stranger to building digital community and culture. With our teams fully remote and located all around the world, we stay connected through company-wide events, coffee chats, fun Slack channels, and peer-to-peer recognition through Bonusly — just to name a few. Our remote environment means that you have the flexibility to make those midday workout classes, take your dog out for a walk when they need one, and run errands on your own schedule. As an intern, you can expect to set core hours with your manager, and then work when you’re at your best. We all thrive in different conditions, so we encourage you to make your workday work for you! 💙 This is a remote opportunity within Canada.

Collaborate with people from across many countries, disciplines and experience levels, who all care a lot about what we’re building.
 What we’re looking for:
 Confidence: A willingness to take on new challenges, and see them through to completion. Humility: You’re not afraid to ask "stupid" questions and make mistakes (as long as you learn from them).
