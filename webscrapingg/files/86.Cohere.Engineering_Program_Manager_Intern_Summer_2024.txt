Who are we? Cohere is focused on building and deploying large language model ( L L M) A I into enterprises in a safe and responsible way that drives human productivity, and creates magical new ways to interact with technology and real business value. We‚Äôre a team of highly motivated and experienced engineers, innovators, and disruptors looking to change the face of technology. Our goals are ambitious, but also concrete and practical. Cohere wants to fundamentally change how businesses operate, making everyone more productive and able to focus on doing better what they do best. Every day, our team breaks new ground, as we build transformational A I technology and products for enterprise and developers to harness the power of L L Ms. Cohere was founded by three global leaders in A I development, including our C E O, Aidan Gomez, who co-created the Transformer, which makes L L Ms possible. Collectively, we‚Äôre driven by the belief that our technology has the potential to revolutionize the way enterprises, their employees, and customers engage with technology through language. Cohere‚Äôs broader research team is world-renowned, having contributed to the development of sentence transformers for semantic search, dynamic adversarial data collection and red teaming, and retrieval augmented generation, often referred to as ‚Äú R A G,‚Äù among other technological breakthroughs. We have been deliberate in assembling a team of operational leaders with industry-leading experience, with backgrounds working at the most sophisticated, demanding, and respected enterprises in the world. Cohere‚Äôs operational leaders have built, scaled, and led multi-billion product lines and businesses at Google, Apple, Rakuten, You Tube, A W S, and Cisco. The Cohere team is a collective from all walks of life, from people who left college to start businesses, to some of the most experienced people from globally renowned companies. We believe a diverse team is the key to a safer, more responsible technology, and that different experiences and backgrounds enable us to tackle problems from all angles and avoid blindspots.

Natural skills in developing relationships with smart and stubborn people, creative lateral thinking skills in new situations, and proven organizational abilities across a tangle of work streams are critical for an E P M intern to build trust, solve problems, and add value during their time at Cohere.¬† E P M interns with these skills will be uniquely rewarded at Cohere. They will build strong 1:1 partnerships with the best people in the A I industry. They will immediately have leadership opportunities across Cohere, with company-level visibility and impact. At this stage in the company where we‚Äôre helping to define the industry but have significant customers, the E P M skills they develop will have an incredible multiplier effect on success; you can essentially change things as fast as you can execute on them. E P M interns will be exposed to and get to learn amazing new things. L L Ms are one of the most important technologies of our generation, and E P M interns will be deeply immersed in the area alongside executive, research, development, marketing, and sales teams in contexts and scenarios they wouldn‚Äôt get in any other internship.
