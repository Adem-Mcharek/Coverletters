Welcome to the D N C Technology Internship Application!  The D N C Technology department is accepting applications for our Summer 2024 Internship Program. This is a separate application from the General D N C Internship Application because it requires specific experience.  We are accepting applications for internships on the Data & Analytics team. Interning at D N C Tech is a unique opportunity for future leaders and civic technologists to gain real life, hands-on experience in Democratic political technology, learn and experience industry data & analytics processes and/or expert information security processes, strengthen understanding of the political process, and prepare for future career opportunities. The program will run from Monday, May 20th, 2024 to Friday, August 9th, 2024 and can be conducted in in-person, hybrid, or remote format. Interns who are based in the Washington D. C. area will have an opportunity to perform in-person work for the D N C at the Democratic National Headquarters and D N C events. You must be located in the United States to apply for this internship.  The D N C Internship Program provides a stipend of $3,600. Housing is not provided. During the upcoming term, interns are expected to work 20 hours per week. The deadline for applications is Wednesday, March 13th, 2024. As an intern with D N C Tech, you will work on a project or projects designed to support the work of the overall Tech team and your own skills and experience. You will build your skills as a technology professional, in either data or security. You will participate in team meetings and work closely with mentor(s). In addition to working on project/s, you may work on a variety of additional tasks relevant to the team you’re interning with.  As an intern with D N C Tech, you’ll learn a lot about the interesting ways in which technology impacts politics. As part of the internship program, you will also be expected to assist the D N C Operations team by attending weekly phone shifts and any mandatory onboarding/offboarding sessions.  In addition, through the internship program, you will have opportunities to participate in grassroots organizing, assist at D N C functions, receive personal development training, and network with D N C leadership and staff. N O T E: The Data team at the D N C are fully remote teams. Tech Interns may work from any contiguous U S time zone. If working from A K or H I, you must be able to work during either Pacific, Mountain, Central, or Eastern time working hours. You will arrange a schedule with a supervisor. Technology interns still have the opportunity to choose among in-person, hybrid, or remote work like every D N C intern, but be aware that your supervisor and mentors will likely be remote.
 An internship at D N C Tech may be a great fit for you if:
 You’re willing to learn new things, and you feel comfortable learning and problem-solving on your own, with guidance from a mentor. You enjoy problem-solving and have strong communication skills. You are excited to learn about the ways that tech can support Democratic politics, and to work on things that help others. You have previous experience in politics, e.g. using Votebuilder, or volunteering for a Democratic campaign. ( This is N O T required.)
 For a data internship, we recommend:
 You have completed at least a semester, ideally two semesters, of computer programming-related courses, O R have equivalent experience. We expect interns on the Data team to have done some computer programming or data manipulation/ analysis previously. Our team uses a lot of S Q L, Python and R but it is okay if you’ve never used one of those before, as long as you have some familiarity with programming or spreadsheet software including Excel or Google Sheets. If you’ve used one of languages or software, or something else similar to one of those, we encourage you to apply!

 In your cover letter, tell us why do you want to intern here, specifically? Tell us about a time you solved a problem or learned something new. ( Briefly - 1 paragraph or less is fine!) Share in your resume or cover letter what software / technology / programming skills and experiences you have.  What are the titles of a couple relevant classes you’ve taken?
