Woven by Toyota is the mobility technology subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation. Our mission is to deliver safe, intelligent, human-centered mobility for all. Through our Arene mobility software platform, safety-first automated driving technology and Toyota Woven City — our test course for advanced mobility — we’re bringing greater freedom, safety and happiness to people and society.  Our unique global culture weaves modern Silicon Valley innovation and time-tested Japanese quality craftsmanship. We leverage these complementary strengths to amplify the capabilities of drivers, foster happiness, and elevate well-being. W H A T Y O U’ L L D O Are you interested in building products and applications for millions of vehicles a year? Do you like building code at a rapid pace? We are looking for Software Engineering Interns who are excited to help build a state-of-the-art automotive platform that is “software first”. We envision the Arene platform will change the way vehicles are made. The ideal candidate will have a passion for technology and thrive in a fast-paced environment. Our team is developing tools and systems using modern software techniques. We need software engineers who excel at building robust software systems to solve challenging problems at scale. A B O U T T H E T E A M Arene’s goal is to open vehicle programming to everyone by simplifying vehicle software development and increasing deployment frequency without compromising safety and security. This will create a whole new market of vehicle application developers who, through software, integrate a vehicle into our daily lives in novel ways. Arene aims to significantly improve how vehicles are designed and developed, and we’re working closely with Toyota to realize this goal in its next-generation vehicles. You will work as a team member on one of our Software teams. Our teams develop software tools to enable deployment of software functionality across large fleets of vehicles, testing and quality control of advanced vehicle automation systems, and online integrity and safety monitoring of those systems. We’re looking for software engineering interns who are passionate about improving the lives of millions through deploying robust robotic systems. No prior robotics experience is necessary, although it doesn’t hurt. W H A T W E’ L L G I V E Y O U The academic objectives for the internship period are two-fold. First, the student has a goal to improve their system architecture design skills for state-of-the-art mobility in vehicle systems. Second, the student has a goal to acquire hands-on capability to solve practical engineering problems in a real industry setup. The student will gain knowledge of system design and software engineering skills during this internship. Woven by Toyota internships are structured to ensure you grow both technically and professionally. You will get a chance to work on real projects that affect future key results of our mission, while receiving constant feedback, with clear goals. You’ll be supported by mentors and managers throughout your internship. At the end of the internship, you will share the results of your project with the team, and others that may be interested in your work.
