The Boring Company was founded to solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic by creating an underground network of tunnels. Today, we are creating the technology to increase tunneling speed and decrease costs by a factor of 10 or more with the ultimate goal of making Hyperloop adoption viable and enabling rapid transit across densely populated regions. As a Software Engineering Intern, you will be responsible for helping build automation and application software for the next generation of tunnel boring machines ( T B M), used to build new underground transportation systems and Hyperloops. This role will primarily be focused on designing and implementing tools to operate, analyze and control The Boring Company’s T B Ms. Within this role, you will have wide exposure to the overall system architecture.
