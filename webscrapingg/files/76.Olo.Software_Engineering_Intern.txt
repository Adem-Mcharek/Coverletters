At Olo, we enable restaurant brands to scale online ordering and delivery, make data-driven business decisions, and personalize the guest experience on- and off-premise. Chances are, if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. We’re looking for Software Engineering Interns to join a variety of our development teams for a 10 week paid internship from June 3rd to August 9th. You will be managed by an Engineering Manager and paired with a mentor from your team at Olo to experience our dedicated process for delivering products using modern tools and technologies. We aim to deeply collaborate and communicate well. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off-limits. We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration and encourage constant refactoring.  In addition to day-to-day team-based work, you will participate in a capstone project alongside interns from other functions, including Product Management and Design. The capstone project involves devising, designing, and implementing a new set of features for Olo’s platform as a team, guided by mentors from across the organization. Past Olo capstones have introduced features which were later incorporated into the platform and released to customers, so it’s a great way to make a lasting impact and develop your skill set! Internship Program structure:- Weeks 1-8, you will work primarily on your Olo team completing critical project work alongside Olo Engineers and Product teams. Mondays will be spent working with your fellow interns and Capstone Mentors designing a Capstone Project. - Weeks 9 + 10 are dedicated exclusively to the Capstone. You can work remotely from anywhere in the U. S. or at Olo’s headquarters in N Y C.
