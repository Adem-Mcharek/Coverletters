We all have important information we need to manage, and protecting it should be easy. Over 100,000 businesses and millions of people log in to 1 Password to unlock smart, simple access to everything they care about. Our vision is to create a safer, simpler digital future for everyone, and our culture values simplicity, honesty and a human-centric approach to solving problems. Come help us unlock peace of mind so everyone can stay safer online. This software developer position is for one of the most interesting teams that work on the 1 Password.com service: The Admin Onboarding and Provisioning ( A O P) team. The A O P team focuses on the hard problems surrounding a business Administrator’s first 60 days with 1 Password, including the automated provisioning of 1 Password accounts within an end-to-end encrypted system. 1 Password values users’ privacy above all else, and this comes with really interesting challenges when integrating with third-party systems. We build software that helps solve these problems without compromising user’s data ownership and privacy. We’re looking for a developer that is comfortable in the back-end and has some familiarity in the front-end. Come join the A O P team to help develop features for 1 Password Business. As one of our developers, you’ll help us ensure that 1 Password is easy for administrators to onboard their whole companies into, some of them onboarding tens of thousands of employees at a time with the help of identity providers ( Okta, Azure A D, Google Workplace, etc.). Remote by design. 1 Password has been remote-first since our inception in 2005, meaning that we’re no stranger to building digital community and culture. With our teams fully remote and located all around the world, we stay connected through company-wide events, coffee chats, fun Slack channels, and peer-to-peer recognition through Bonusly — just to name a few. Our remote environment means that you have the flexibility to make those midday workout classes, take your dog out for a walk when they need one, and run errands on your own schedule. As an intern, you can expect to set core hours with your manager, and then work when you’re at your best. We all thrive in different conditions, so we encourage you to make your workday work for you! 💙 This is a remote opportunity within Canada. This position will be for 4 months - May to August 2024.
 What you can expect:
 Write efficient, scalable, and robust customer-facing features in our web stack. Collaborate with people across the company like Product Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, Quality Assurance, and other Software Development teams. Interpret data to design, build, test, and validate impactful solutions for customer problems. Take a full stack approach to development by navigating everything from databases up to the frontend U I.
 What we’re looking for:
 Confidence: A willingness to take on new challenges, and see them through to completion. Humility: You’re not afraid to ask "stupid" questions and make mistakes (as long as you learn from them).

 Bonus points for:
 Experience building systems that interact with provisioning protocols and Id Ps. Experience interacting with 3rd party technical teams. Experience with Kubernetes, Docker and/or Helm. Experience with cloud providers like A W S, G C P or Azure. We never know where our customers might want to deploy our applications. Even if you don’t tick all those boxes, we’d like to hear from you. The most important thing you can bring to this job is the drive to dive in, get the work done, and fix root causes instead of treating symptoms. We believe in continuous learning and support professional development on the job with a budget to back it up. If you bring a desire to do the right thing for our customers, a sense of ownership over the product you work on, and a focus on shipping quality code, we want to hear from you. This role will close on February 15th, 2024. What we offer: We believe in working hard, and resting hard.
