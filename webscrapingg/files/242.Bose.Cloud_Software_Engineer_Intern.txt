Job Description A B O U T B O S E You know the moment. It’s the first notes of that song you love, the intro to your favorite movie, or simply the sound of someone you love saying “hello.” It’s in these moments that sound matters most. At Bose, we believe sound is the most powerful force on earth. And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “ I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.  Innovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers. And we’re passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical. T H E P R O G R A M We’re looking for students to join our Internship Program who are obsessively curious about ’what’s next’. You’ll get hands on experience with our products and learn from the best of the best in the business. You will complete a specific project in 10-12 weeks with us, while integrating into your team. By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career! Opportunities don’t stop at your day-to-day work. While you’re getting a targeted look at your area of expertise, we’ll expose you to other areas of the company. Our interns are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You’ll network with other interns and colleagues to grow your network for the future!  Timeframe - June- August 2024  T H E R O L E The Bose Software Organization is looking for a Summer Intern to help us bring new experiences to our customers. Bose is building the platforms and tools that will allow us to rapidly develop, test, distribute and evaluate new software concepts, bringing new apps and algorithms to our existing and next-generation products. The software components that we build will accelerate concept development, allowing us to test out new ideas within Bose and in our new public Beta program. We are creating a pipeline of new software experiences that will deliver clear value to our customers. The unique structure of our project means that while individual experiences come and go, the tools and libraries that we build are re-used and enhanced over time. With each new experience, we have the opportunity to solve new problems and improve the tools available across the company. As a developer you will work closely with a team to design and build our cloud platform to bring new software experiences to life.
