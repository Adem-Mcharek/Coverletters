Who are we? Cohere is focused on building and deploying large language model ( L L M) A I into enterprises in a safe and responsible way that drives human productivity, and creates magical new ways to interact with technology and real business value. We‚Äôre a team of highly motivated and experienced engineers, innovators, and disruptors looking to change the face of technology. Our goals are ambitious, but also concrete and practical. Cohere wants to fundamentally change how businesses operate, making everyone more productive and able to focus on doing better what they do best. Every day, our team breaks new ground, as we build transformational A I technology and products for enterprise and developers to harness the power of L L Ms. Cohere was founded by three global leaders in A I development, including our C E O, Aidan Gomez, who co-created the Transformer, which makes L L Ms possible. Collectively, we‚Äôre driven by the belief that our technology has the potential to revolutionize the way enterprises, their employees, and customers engage with technology through language. Cohere‚Äôs broader research team is world-renowned, having contributed to the development of sentence transformers for semantic search, dynamic adversarial data collection and red teaming, and retrieval augmented generation, often referred to as ‚Äú R A G,‚Äù among other technological breakthroughs. We have been deliberate in assembling a team of operational leaders with industry-leading experience, with backgrounds working at the most sophisticated, demanding, and respected enterprises in the world. Cohere‚Äôs operational leaders have built, scaled, and led multi-billion product lines and businesses at Google, Apple, Rakuten, You Tube, A W S, and Cisco. The Cohere team is a collective from all walks of life, from people who left college to start businesses, to some of the most experienced people from globally renowned companies. We believe a diverse team is the key to a safer, more responsible technology, and that different experiences and backgrounds enable us to tackle problems from all angles and avoid blindspots. There‚Äôs no better time to play a role in defining the future of A I, and its impact on the world. Why this role? This role is for students who are excited about building the next generation of machine learning models and N L P products. Our S W E roles can cover creating datasets for machine learning, scaling the pods to serve our A P I, or even building out new security features on our platform. We don‚Äôt distinguish much between interns and full-time employees, and you‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to push code to production. You‚Äôll have full autonomy and ownership over high-impact work, and will be backed by the support of an incredible team or leaders & mentors. Join us at a pivotal moment, shape what we build, and wear multiple hats! We‚Äôre currently hiring for multiple teams and roles, including Frontend, Backend, Full-stack, and Infrastructure roles.
