N V I D I A is leading the way in groundbreaking developments in Artificial Intelligence, High- Performance Computing, and Visualization. The G P U, our invention, serves as the visual cortex of modern computers and is at the heart of our products and services. Our work opens up new universes to explore, enables outstanding creativity and discovery, and powers what were once science fiction inventions from artificial intelligence to autonomous cars. N V I D I A is looking for a highly motivated individual to join the Datacenter Product Validation Team as an intern. This position is responsible for system validation and post-production activities for N V I D I A datacenter server products, such as H G X baseboards and D G X Servers. You will need to maintain a close relationship with all members of the architecture, hardware and software design teams to guarantee they are prepared to rigorously test and debug all new features and changes made during the product development. You should be very comfortable in a lab environment and should demonstrate a passion towards product system level validation. What you’ll be doing: Work closely with system architects, hardware and software design engineers, and project managers to maintain good understanding of the design and ongoing changes. Build detailed and rigorous test plans based on the system design, and look for improvements, tools, and N V I D I A server products. Drive system integration and verification tests along with other validation engineers to enable rapid iteration of the server design. Work closely with Validation leads to conduct P H Y layer electrical debug and measurements on prototype hardware. Drive debug and resolution of issues found. Influence future system designs to avoid them. Develop methods and tools to execute tests, evaluate and document results, in collaboration with subject specialists in an efficient and reliable manner. Investigate factory yield and field issues. What we need to see: Pursuing a B S or M S degree. Experience in Scripting languages (i.e., Python, Java, Perl or Tcl ) for bench automation. Experience with complicated systems including silicon bringup, board-level design/validation, or system design/validation. Understanding P C architecture and familiar with various datacenter system products. Experience with system level verification, I O interconnect, P C I- Express high-speed data switches. Strong circuit analysis and debugging skills, and experience with B M C & server management processors. Experience with test equipment setups for high-speed and low-speed signal measurement. Knowledge of Linux operating system and networking. Ways to stand out from the crowd: Experience in P C Ie protocol and compliance testing Understanding of data center management tools, server architecture, system mechanics A solid understanding of the electrical characteristics of I O interfaces such as I2 C, J T A G, and S P I.
