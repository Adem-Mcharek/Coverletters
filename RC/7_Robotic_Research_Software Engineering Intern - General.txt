Clarksburg, MD 

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently learned about the Software Engineering Intern position at Robotic Research through your company’s career portal. As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University, with a cumulative GPA of 3.88 and a keen interest in autonomous vehicle systems and robotics, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team’s pioneering work in automated vehicle (AV) solutions.

My academic background includes comprehensive courses in Machine Learning, Applicable Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering, equipping me with a solid foundation in the key technologies driving the development of state-of-the-art autonomous systems. I have honed my practical skills through several projects, notably, orchestrating an AI Research Assistant using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system and developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits. My project on Computer Vision using TensorFlow, where I developed a hand gesture recognition system achieving an 85% recall rate, directly aligns with the innovative work at Robotic Research.

Furthermore, my leadership as the founder and president of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn and success in numerous international competitions, including securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and a People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN, demonstrate my ability to drive projects to success and my commitment to leveraging technology for positive impact.

I am particularly drawn to Robotic Research’s mission of using robotics to change lives and protect warfighters and am eager to bring my skills in AI and machine learning to your team. I am available for the duration of the summer of 2024 and can temporarily relocate to Clarksburg, MD as required. I will reach out next week to follow up, but please feel free to contact me anytime at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the exciting projects at Robotic Research.

Sincerely,
Adem Mcharek
