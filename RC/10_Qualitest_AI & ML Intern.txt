Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the AI & ML Intern position at Qualitest, as advertised on the Internet. With a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning from my academic pursuits at Long Island University and hands-on experience through various projects, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Qualitest's innovative initiatives.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence with a cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00, I have comprehensively studied and engaged with subjects pertinent to this role, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining. My hands-on experience, highlighted by my role as an AI Research Assistant, where I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, demonstrates a proficient application of programming fundamentals in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other relevant languages and technologies.

In addition to technical expertise, my participation in diverse projects—such as developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits, creating a hand gesture recognition system, and leading the AI Club at my university—has equipped me with a robust technical foundation and a profound ability to adapt and apply new skills effectively. These experiences have honed my commitment to software craftsmanship, especially in contexts requiring rigorous code review, unit testing, and the application of design patterns.

I bring a unique blend of leadership, creativity, and technical proficiency, underpinned by a fervent commitment to continuous learning and innovation. As an avid participant in the AI Club and various international competitions, I have demonstrated an ability to think critically and innovatively, qualities that I understand are critical to success at Qualitest.

I am eager to bring my background in AI and ML technologies, along with my passion for software craftsmanship and continuous learning, to the AI Intern team at Qualitest. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how my background aligns with Qualitest's goals and to explore the possibility of contributing to your team. 

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to Qualitest.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
