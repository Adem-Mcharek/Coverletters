Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Federal Engineering Intern position at Virtru, as advertised on your careers page. My academic background in Artificial Intelligence, combined with my hands-on experience in software development and a strong passion for data privacy and security, aligns well with the responsibilities and requirements of this role. As a dedicated student at Long Island University, I have consistently engaged in projects that not only demonstrate my technical capabilities but also my commitment to impactful software development.

During my tenure at Long Island University, I have actively participated in and led numerous projects that highlight my **hard skills** essential for the Federal Engineering Intern role at Virtru. I have developed a deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system utilizing TensorFlow, demonstrating my proficiency in **Python, deep learning frameworks, and computer vision**. Additionally, my project on developing an AI Research Assistant using AUTOGEN's multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval underscores my **familiarity with data structures, algorithms**, and software design patterns. Notably, my work in creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits showcases my solid understanding of the software development process, further augmented by my experience in web app development for real-time fruit detection.

Furthermore, my **soft skills**, such as leadership, collaboration, and innovation, have been honed through my role as Founder and President of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn. This experience has cultivated a vibrant community of over 50 AI enthusiasts, exemplifying my ability to **work collaboratively in a fast-paced environment and adapt to shifting priorities** as described in your job posting. My recognition in international competitions, including the People's Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN and securing a place in the NASA Space Apps Challenge, underscores my **action-oriented mindset and desire to learn and grow** with a team.

I am incredibly excited about the opportunity to contribute to Virtru's mission of changing the rules for data privacy. My eagerness to delve into projects that develop web-based products for viewing TDF encrypted files and my interest in working within the federal sector position me as an ideal candidate for this internship. 

I am available to commence the internship in Summer 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you in a week to discuss my application further. In the meantime, I thank you for considering my application and hope to contribute to Virtru's success, while growing professionally within your esteemed organization.

Warmest regards,

Adem Mcharek
