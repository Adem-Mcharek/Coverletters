Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Summer 2024 SRE Intern position at Virtru. I discovered this exciting opportunity through an Internet search on cutting-edge technology internships. Given my background in Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning, and project development, I am confident in my ability to positively contribute to your team.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University with a cumulative GPA of 3.88, I have engaged in projects like developing a multi-agent AI Research Assistant and a hand gesture recognition system utilizing TensorFlow. This work highlights my **experience hosting and running applications** in environments requiring complex computations and **real-time data processing**. Furthermore, my practical knowledge of **Python** and **Cloud Computing**, complemented by my hands-on experience in **software engineering and modern cryptography**, positions me well to thrive in maintaining and supporting a large SaaS system deployed on GCP.

My leadership role as the Founder and President of the “AI Club” at LIU Brooklyn has honed my soft skills, particularly in **collaborating and adapting** to shifting priorities - qualities highly desirable for your internship position. My involvement in various team projects and hackathons, including securing awards from prestigious competitions such as the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and the UN's #hackathon4Justice, showcases my **strong analytical and creative abilities**, and my **action-oriented mindset**.

I am eager to bring my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and cloud computing to Virtru, complementing my robust programming skills. I am available for this internship from the beginning of Summer 2024 and can be reached at the phone number and email address mentioned above. I will follow up next week to discuss this application and look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to help Virtru advance its data privacy solutions and eagerly await the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your company.

Warmest regards,

Adem Mcharek
