Hiring Manager  
Virtru  
Washington, D.C.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently discovered the opportunity for a Software Developer in Test – Intern at Virtru through an online job portal, and I am thrilled to submit my application. As a passionate Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University, with a strong background in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and TensorFlow, and accolades in both local and international competitions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Virtru's innovative testing and quality assurance initiatives.

During my academic career and through my projects, such as the AI Research Assistant initiative and the Computer Vision using TensorFlow application, I have honed my **skills in developing and optimizing machine learning models** and **software testing**. These projects, detailed on my resume, have not only solidified my programming skills but also taught me the importance of thorough testing and documentation—skills that are directly relevant to the Software Developer in Test – Intern role.

My time as the founder and president of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has imbued me with the **leadership and teamwork skills** necessary to succeed in a collaborative environment like Virtru. This role required me to challenge the status quo and think outside the box, aligning with Virtru's qualities that emphasize the pursuit of excellence and the ability to adapt to shifting priorities. My **strong sense of urgency and action-oriented mindset**, backed by my achievements in orchestrating complex AI projects and leading the AI community, reflect my capacity to contribute meaningfully to your team.

I'm particularly excited about this role at Virtru because of its focus on data protection and respect for data privacy—a mission that resonates with my personal values and professional goals. The chance to work with technologies such as **JavaScript**, **Docker**, and **automated test scripts** in an environment that fosters growth and curiosity is precisely the opportunity I have been looking for.

I am available for a summer internship, fully prepared to immerse myself in learning and contributing to Virtru's success. I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or through email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms can be in line with the innovative work being done at Virtru.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my application in further detail and am excited about the prospect of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
