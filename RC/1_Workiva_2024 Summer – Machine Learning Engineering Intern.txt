Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

I was thrilled to learn about the opportunity for the [Position Name] role through [source - e.g., LinkedIn, your company website]. Given my academic background as a Bachelor’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, coupled with my hands-on experience in AI research, project leadership, and machine learning developments, I am excited to bring my expertise to [Company’s Name].

During my time at LIU Brooklyn, I have dedicated myself to several advanced projects, such as orchestrating an AI Research Assistant with AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system and developing a hand gesture recognition system with an 85% recall rate using SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite. These experiences have not only showcased my ability to leverage machine learning and neural network architecture but also underscored my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more. My academic achievements, including a cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00 and relevant coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Cloud Computing, among others, have prepared me for the complex challenges in the AI industry.

Equally important to my technical skills, my role as the Founder and President of the "AI Club" at LIU Brooklyn has honed my leadership and communication abilities, managing over 50 members and fostering a collaborative environment for AI enthusiasts. My ability to motivate, mentor, and lead projects demonstrates my capacity to contribute significantly to your team not only as a technical specialist but also as a team player and potential leader.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the goals of [Company’s Name]. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to inquire about arranging a time to speak with you about how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn more about the [Position Name] role and to share how I can contribute to the innovative work at [Company’s Name].

Warm regards,

Adem Mcharek
