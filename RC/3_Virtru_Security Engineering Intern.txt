Hiring Manager  
Virtru  
Washington, District of Columbia  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I was thrilled to discover the opening for a Security Engineering Intern at Virtru through your company website. With my ongoing Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, my hands-on experience with high-level programming languages including Python, and my ongoing AI research that touches on multiple facets of technology, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Virtru's mission of securing data privacy through groundbreaking solutions.

My academic journey has been highlighted by a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, cloud computing, and software engineering, equipping me with a comprehensive understanding of the technological underpinnings required for effective security engineering. Notably, I've orchestrated multiple AI-related projects, such as developing a real-time academic literature retrieval system using AUTOGENâ€™s multi-agent system and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for the MNIST dataset, which have honed my skills in Python programming and complex problem-solving.

Furthermore, my initiative in founding and presiding over the AI Club at Long Island University reflects my leadership abilities and my commitment to fostering a community of tech enthusiasts. Under my leadership, the club has quickly grown to include over 50 members, illustrating my capacity to inspire and collaborate with peers toward common goals. This experience has prepared me to thrive in team-based environments and to contribute to Virtru's engineering and information security teams effectively.

I am particularly drawn to Virtru's commitment to data privacy and the cutting-edge work your team is doing in Zero-Trust architectures. I am eager to bring my skills in software development, experience in AI projects, and passion for digital privacy to your innovative team. I am confident that my proactive nature and willingness to engage in continuous learning make me a great fit for the Security Engineering Intern position.

I am available for an internship during the Summer of 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my application in further detail and am planning to follow up with you next week to inquire about the possibility of arranging a meeting.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Virtru's success and to further develop my skills under the guidance of your expert team.

Best regards,

Adem Mcharek
