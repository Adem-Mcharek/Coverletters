Hiring Manager  
Match Group  
Dallas, Texas  

Dear Hiring Team at Match Group,

I am writing to express my interest in the Machine Learning Intern position at Match Group, which I learned about through an online job posting. My background in Artificial Intelligence, combined with my hands-on projects in machine learning, makes me a strong candidate for this role. Your commitment to diversity, safety, privacy, and inclusivity in technology-driven connections resonates with my professional values and aspirations.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University Brooklyn, where I have maintained a Cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00. Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken projects and courses that align directly with the requirements and responsibilities outlined in your job posting. Notably, I have developed a PyTorch CNN for MNIST and a Computer Vision system using TensorFlow, demonstrating my **proficiency in Python** and hands-on experience in **designing and building M L models**. My project, "AI Research Assistant," showcases my practical knowledge of **building efficient end-to-end M L workflows** and foundational knowledge of **basic Computer Science principles**. These projects are highlighted by my involvement in international competitions, securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and participation in the #hackathon4Justice by the UN, evidencing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, impactful challenges.

Possessing a sound understanding of **M L frameworks like PyTorch** and experience in research assistant roles, I am equipped with the skills necessary to design deep learning models for computer vision and natural language processing, as described in your job posting. My experience aligns with Match Group's immense data challenges, and I am eager to contribute to developing machine learning solutions that improve user experience and further Tinderâ€™s business goals.

I am highly interested in the opportunity to join the Tindership program, where I can bring my strong foundation in machine learning and enthusiasm for technology-driven human connections. I am available for an in-office collaboration in Los Angeles as required for this hybrid role and eager to contribute to Match Group's mission of keeping the magic of human connection alive. 

Please feel free to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms can contribute to the innovative projects at Match Group. I plan to follow up next week to inquire about the possibility of an interview.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the team and achieve our shared goals.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
