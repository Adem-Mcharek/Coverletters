Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Machine Learning Engineer Intern position at Moloco, as advertised on [source]. As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University with a cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my academic background and project experiences in machine learning and data science to contribute to Moloco’s mission of making digital economy more transparent and performance advertising more accessible through advanced machine learning technologies.

During my education, I have honed my skills through various projects and research roles. Notably, my role as an AI Research Assistant involved the orchestration of an AI research assistant using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval. This endeavor required an in-depth understanding of machine learning models, including RAG for transforming scholarly research and dialogue synthesis. Additionally, my work on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits and a hand gesture recognition system utilizing SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite are testaments to my proficiency in implementing and optimizing machine learning models for real-world applications.

Beyond my technical abilities, my leadership experience as the Founder and President of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has equipped me with strong interpersonal and teamwork skills. It has offered me a platform to collaborate with other enthusiasts and foster a community passionate about advancing AI technologies. My participation in internationally recognized competitions, including securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and the People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN, reflect my problem-solving skills and commitment to excellence.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with Moloco’s engineering team to further explore and innovate in machine learning applications within advertising technology. My willingness to relocate to Seattle, WA, or Redwood City, CA, combined with my academic credentials and project experiences, make me a strong candidate for this internship position.

I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to Moloco’s groundbreaking work. I will follow up with you next week to answer any preliminary questions you might have. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Moloco’s goals.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
