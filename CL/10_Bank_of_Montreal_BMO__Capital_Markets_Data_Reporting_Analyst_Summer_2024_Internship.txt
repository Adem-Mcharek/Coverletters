Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently discovered the exciting opportunity for a Capital Markets Data Reporting Analyst Summer 2024 Internship at BMO through my diligent search for challenging roles that align with my rigorous academic work and projects in data analysis and machine learning. Understanding BMO's esteemed position in the industry and its commitment to delivering unparalleled services has profoundly motivated me to apply, as I eagerly look forward to contributing my skills and learning from such a distinguished team.

As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University Brooklyn, I have cultivated a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **software engineering**, maintaining an impressive cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00. Notably, my involvement as an AI Research Assistant has sharpened my proficiency in **data extraction and manipulation**, showcased through projects like the development of an AI Research Assistant using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system and a **hand gesture recognition system** using TensorFlow, with direct applications in data reporting and analysis.

I bring a compelling blend of technical skills vital for the responsibilities outlined in the internship, such as proficiency in **MS Office, MS BI, VBA, SQL, and MS Visual Studio**, mirrored in the projects I've undertaken. My experience with **Python’s PyTorch** for implementing Convolutional Neural Networks and **TensorFlow for computer vision** demonstrates my capability and readiness to develop and implement new reporting for Investment and Corporate Banking, as well as Global Markets at BMO.

Moreover, my soft skills, accentuated by my leadership as the **Founder and President of the AI Club** at LIU Brooklyn, signify my ability to collaborate effectively with team members and departments, a critical aspect of contributing to BMO's project and team meetings. My accolades, including the **People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN and the World Bank** and securing a **bronze medal in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad**, underscore my commitment to excellence and innovation.

I am eager to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the needs of BMO Capital Markets. You may reach me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to ensure you’ve received my application and to inquire about the possibility of discussing my application in more detail.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the success of BMO Capital Markets and gaining invaluable experience through the internship.

Sincerely,
