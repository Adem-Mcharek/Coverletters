Dear [Recipient Name],

I recently came across the [Job Title] position advertised on [where you found the job posting], and after thoroughly reviewing the qualifications and duties involved, I am excited to submit my application. The role's emphasis on [specific job requirement, e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning] closely aligns with both my academic background and my career aspirations. 

With a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University Brooklyn, where I maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00, I have a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and data mining. My role as an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn, where I spearheaded projects using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval, has equipped me with the necessary skills to excel in innovative and dynamic environments. This hands-on experience, complemented by my foundational knowledge in Python, TensorFlow, Docker, and several other programming languages, positions me as a strong candidate for this role.

In addition to my technical abilities, I have demonstrated significant leadership and collaborative skills. As the founder and president of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn, I have built a community of over 50 AI enthusiasts, leading projects that advance our understanding and application of various AI disciplines. My ability to think critically and solve complex problems was further honed through my involvement in Math Olympiads, securing over 20 victories in national and international competitions.

Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.
