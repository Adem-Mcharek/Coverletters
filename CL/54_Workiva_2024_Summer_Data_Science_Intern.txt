Hiring Manager

Ames, Iowa  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently came across the exciting opportunity for a Data Science Intern position at Workiva for the summer of 2024 through your online job posting. The combination of Workiva's mission to power transparent reporting and my background in Artificial Intelligence and data-oriented projects has motivated me to apply for this role. Furthermore, my strong academic foundation at Long Island University and my hands-on experience in AI and machine learning projects make me a great fit for your team.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence with a notable Cumulative GPA of 3.88, I have delved deep into courses such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and Natural Language Processing. These academic pursuits have equipped me with a solid understanding of machine learning techniques, as highlighted by Workiva's requirements. Beyond the classroom, my **hands-on programming experience** has been demonstrated through various projects. Notably, as an AI Research Assistant, I orchestrated a real-time academic literature retrieval system using AUTOGEN's multi-agent system. Additionally, I've developed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow, showcasing my proficiency in **data cleaning, preparation, and the application of data science libraries** like TensorFlow.

My experience extends to **source control systems such as Git** for project management, evidenced by the collaborative and leadership roles I've undertaken. As the founder and president of the "AI Club" at LIU Brooklyn, I've demonstrated my strong communication and organizational skills, rallying over 50 enthusiasts and fostering a vibrant community centered around AI innovations. This role has sharpened my **collaborative and leadership abilities**, key soft skills that align with Workiva's value of collaboration and inclusive community building.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills to the Data Science Intern role at Workiva. I am available for the duration of the summer internship and beyond, should there be an opportunity to extend my contribution to the fall. I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you in a week to discuss how I can contribute to Workiva and further discuss my application.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Workiva's mission and engaging in meaningful projects that drive transparency and innovation.

Sincerely,  

Adem Mcharek
