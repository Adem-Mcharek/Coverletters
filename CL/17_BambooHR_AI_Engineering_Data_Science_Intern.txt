Hiring Manager  
BambooHR  
Lindon, Utah  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently learned about the AI Engineering / Data Science Intern position at BambooHR through an online search, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your esteemed AI and machine learning initiatives. As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University, boasting a cumulative GPA of 3.88 and extensive hands-on experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data processing project executions, I am eager to bring my skills and passion for creative problem-solving and impactful technology development to your team.

In my academic journey, I have completed relevant courses such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and Natural Language Processing. **My education has armed me with a solid foundation in computing and data science, which I have applied to several real-world projects.** Notably, I led a team as an **AI Research Assistant**, where we created an innovative multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval, leveraging AUTOGEN, RAG transforming, and implemented a CNN in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy. This experience not only honed my coding and algorithm design skills but also demonstrated my ability to innovate and improve processes through technology.

Furthermore, at LIU Brooklyn, I developed a hand gesture recognition system using SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite, achieving an 85% recall rate, highlighting my proficiency with **TensorFlow**, neural networks, and predictive modeling. My leadership in founding and presiding over the AI Club, escalating its membership to over 50 enthusiasts, attests to my ability to work collaboratively and engage with stakeholders meaningfully. This aligns well with BambooHR's focus on teamwork and stakeholder collaboration as outlined in the internship description.

I am particularly drawn to this internship because of BambooHR's commitment to enhancing employee experiences through technology and its inclusive and supportive culture. I believe my background in **AI**, combined with my demonstrated skills in **data visualization, machine learning modeling, and using cloud-based computing environments (AWS and GCP)**, as well as my passion for creative problem-solving, will enable me to significantly contribute to your AI projects. Moreover, my accolades, including the People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice and securing medals at various Mathematical Olympiads, underline my dedication and capability to excel in challenging environments.

I am eager to share how I can contribute to BambooHR’s mission to set people free to do meaningful work through innovative AI solutions. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you next week to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
