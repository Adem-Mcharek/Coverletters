Hiring Manager  
Kodiak Robotics  
Mountain View, CA

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Summer 2024 Intern Data Science position at Kodiak Robotics, which I learned about through an advertisement on LinkedIn. With a profound interest in improving the efficiency and safety of long-haul transportation through advanced technology, and my background in AI and statistical analysis, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Kodiak's mission to carry freight forward.

As a Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University, with a Cumulative GPA of 3.88, I have acquired strong analytical skills and a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, cloud computing, and data mining. My coursework in Applicable Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering has prepared me for the technical demands of this internship. Notably, my role as an AI Research Assistant involved developing an AI-based multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval, showcasing my ability to apply machine learning models to real-world problems【9†source】.

During my projects, such as developing a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch for the MNIST dataset and a hand gesture recognition system utilizing TensorFlow, I demonstrated not only my proficiency with Python and SQL but also my capability to generate data-driven solutions【9†source】. These experiences align with the requirements and responsibilities of the Data Science Intern role, which includes using machine learning and statistical analysis to build product solutions, and ensuring clean and reliable data metrics for autonomy performance evaluation【11†source】.

Beyond my technical skills, I am recognized for my leadership and ability to communicate complex data in a straightforward manner. As the Founder and President of the AI Club at Long Island University, I grew the membership to over 50 enthusiasts, fostering a community of innovation and collaboration【9†source】. This role honed my persuasive skills, teamwork, and the capacity to translate data insights into actionable strategies, which I believe are crucial for succeeding at Kodiak Robotics.

I am eager to learn more about Kodiak Robotics' advanced technology stack and contribute to your team with my background in data science and machine learning. I am available for this internship starting in May 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how my skills and achievements align with Kodiak Robotics' goals and to learn more about this exciting opportunity.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Kodiak Robotics' innovative projects and being a part of your team's mission to revolutionize freight transportation.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek-------/n
