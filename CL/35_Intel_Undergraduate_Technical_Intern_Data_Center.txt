Dear Hiring Manager,

I was thrilled to come across the Undergraduate Technical Intern opportunity in Intel's Data Center as posted on your company's career page. With a rigorous academic background in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University and hands-on experience in various programming languages, Linux server administration, and high-performance computing (HPC), I am excited to apply for this position to contribute to Intel's mission of creating world-changing technology.

During my education and through multiple innovative projects, I have honed my skills in developing and optimizing AI and machine learning algorithms, with particular proficiency in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Linux operating systems【9†source】. My work as an AI Research Assistant involved orchestrating a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, demonstrating my capability in high-performance computing applications, which aligns closely with the responsibilities of the Technical Intern as outlined in the job description【11†source】. My involvement in projects such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification and a computer vision system for hand gesture recognition illustrated my deep understanding of the technical concepts, architectures, and development methods crucial for performance optimization and reliability in computing systems.

Furthermore, winning awards in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and collaborating on projects that won the People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN and World Bank underscores my strong problem-solving skills and ability to contribute positively to team efforts. My leadership experience as the founder and president of the “AI Club” at LIU Brooklyn has equipped me with excellent communication, mentorship, and team collaboration skills, vital for thriving in Intel's collaborative and innovative environment.

I am eager to bring my passion for cutting-edge technology, my software development skills, and my experience in high-performance computing to Intel's Datacenter and AI Solutions organization. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with Intel's latest technologies in HPC and AI data center solutions, aiding in the development, performance optimization, and benchmarking of computing clusters.

I am available to start the internship at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the needs of your team. I plan to follow up next week to inquire about the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the remarkable work being done at Intel and to learn and grow with your esteemed team.

Warm regards,

Adem Mcharek
