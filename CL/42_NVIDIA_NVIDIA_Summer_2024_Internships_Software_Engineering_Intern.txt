Santa Clara, California  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Intern position for Summer 2024 at NVIDIA, a company at the forefront of solving the world’s most stimulating technology problems, as advertised on your careers page. My passion for Artificial Intelligence and my academic and project-based experience have equipped me with a strong foundation in the key skills required for this role, particularly in Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, GPU Development, and Data Science.

Presently, I am pursuing a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University Brooklyn, where I have been rigorously trained in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering among other relevant courses. **My GPA of 3.88/4.00 stands testament to my academic diligence**. Moreover, as an AI Research Assistant, I led a multi-agent system project for real-time academic literature retrieval showcasing my capability in handling complex AI projects. This, coupled with my development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for MNIST digit classification and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow, exemplifies my **strong programming skills in Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow**, aligning seamlessly with the desired qualifications for the internship.

My contributions to versatile projects, including the application of SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite for real-time detection and my leadership in founding the "AI Club" at the university, underscore my deep **understanding of GPU Development** and further highlight my **persuasive skills**; forming a vibrant community of over 50 AI enthusiasts. These experiences have not only honed my technical acumen but have also bolstered my ability to lead, innovate, and collaborate effectively on high-level projects.

Available for the entirety of Summer 2024, I am eager to bring my combination of knowledge and experience to NVIDIA, contributing to ambitious projects such as building GPU-accelerated AI Streaming platforms and enhancing storage and data platform technologies. I am confident my background equips me to make meaningful contributions to NVIDIA’s pioneering software teams.

I plan to follow up with you in a week to discuss my application and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my education, skills, and interests align with the needs of NVIDIA’s Software Engineering team.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
