**Key Achievements and Skills:**

- **Research & Development:** As an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn, I orchestrated a multi-agent system with AUTOGEN for real-time academic literature retrieval, showcasing my capability to employ AI in solving complex problems.
- **Problem-Solving:** Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills by securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and the Arabic Mathematical Olympiad, emphasizing my analytical capabilities and adaptive thinking.

I am particularly excited about the prospect of joining Qualitest, a global leader in AI-powered Quality Engineering, to further your commitment to innovation, diversity, and software craftsmanship. I am keen to support existing technologies, engage in unit testing, conduct code reviews, and apply design patterns, in line with your internship requirements. Further, my involvement in diversity and inclusion initiatives, leadership in founding the "AI Club" at LIU, and a proactive approach towards continuous learning align with Qualitest's values and objectives.

I am available to start this internship at your earliest convenience, and I am open to discussing how I can contribute to Qualitest in more detail. I will follow up next week to explore the possibility of an interview. Should you need any additional information, please feel free to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.
