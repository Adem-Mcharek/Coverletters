Hiring Manager

[Office Address]  
Dallas, Texas  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist Intern position at Match Group, as advertised on [Where You Found The Job Posting]. As a final year Bachelor student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, Brooklyn, with a cum laude GPA and a rich portfolio of projects demonstrating my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and AI, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my academic background and project experience to contribute to your team.

Throughout my academic career, I have undertaken projects that have honed my hard skills crucial for this role. Notably, my work as an AI Research Assistant involved orchestrating a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, showcasing my ability to handle large datasets and implement machine learning models effectively. This aligns with the responsibilities of querying and analyzing in-app user behavior and applying ML models to derive insights, as detailed in your job posting. Additionally, my project developing a hand gesture recognition system with an 85% recall rate demonstrates my proficiency in computer vision, a skill that is beneficial for creating new types of visualizations for Tinder's dataset.

On the soft skills front, as the founder and president of the AI Club at my university, I spearheaded the growth of the club to over 50 members, underlining my leadership, collaborative, and innovative problem-solving abilities. This experience has prepared me to work effectively with Match Group's cross-functional teams in Product, Engineering, Design, Finance, and Marketing, identifying and exploring new product/marketing opportunities as well as potential improvements to data infrastructure.

I am available to start the internship in Summer 2024 and can adapt to the hybrid work requirement in Los Angeles, CA. I am eager to bring my background in AI, machine learning, data visualization, and collaborative project management to the Match Group team. I will follow up next week to discuss how I can contribute to your team; meanwhile, I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Match Group's goals and contribute to the innovation and growth of your products.

Sincerely,  
Adem McHarek
