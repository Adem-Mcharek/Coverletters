My understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems is deeply ingrained through both my coursework and these project experiences. 

In addition to my technical skills, my tenure as the founder and president of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has honed my leadership and collaborative skills, pivotal for working with cross-functional teams【9†source】. This experience reflects my capacity for teamwork and my proclivity for innovation and finding practical solutions to complex problems. 

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills to the Cadence Design Systems team, contributing to the development of data platform components and applications.
