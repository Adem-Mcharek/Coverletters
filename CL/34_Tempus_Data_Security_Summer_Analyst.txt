Dear Hiring Manager,

I was thrilled to learn about the Data Security Summer Analyst position at Tempus through the Internet, particularly because of your company's innovative use of artificial intelligence in precision medicine. As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student with a cumulative GPA of 3.88 at Long Island University, I am eager to apply my background in machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering to contribute to Tempus's mission of enhancing patient care through data-driven insights.

Throughout my academic and project involvement, I have garnered key skills directly applicable to the requirements of this position. My experience as an AI Research Assistant has afforded me the opportunity to work on real-time academic literature retrieval using AUTOGEN's multi-agent system, demonstrating my capacity to apply artificial intelligence solutions in a healthcare context. Additionally, developing a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch and a hand gesture recognition system utilizing TensorFlow showcases my proficiency with the scripting languages Python and expertise in machine learning, aligning with Tempus’s focus on leveraging AI for clinical care.

My proactive involvement in founding and leading the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn exemplifies my strong leadership and communication abilities. By fostering a community of over 50 AI enthusiasts and steering high-level projects, I have honed my skills in collaborating with diverse teams, essential for excelling in the fast-paced environment at Tempus.

I am particularly excited about the prospect of contributing to the Generative AI Governance and the HIPAA Risk Assessment projects outlined for the summer internship. My academic foundation, coupled with my hands-on experience in AI, positions me uniquely to support Tempus in these endeavors, ensuring compliance and driving innovation in healthcare technology.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss the possibility of contributing to Tempus’s groundbreaking work. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to the Tempus team.

Warmest regards,

Adem Mcharek
