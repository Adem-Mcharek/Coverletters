Hiring Manager  
Elevance Health  
Indianapolis, Indiana  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst Internship for Summer 2024 at Elevance Health, as advertised on your company’s career portal. With a strong academic foundation in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University and hands-on projects that align closely with Elevance Health's mission to reimagine the health system, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your Carelon Digital Platforms team.

During my studies, I have focused on practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, I **orchestrated an AI Research Assistant** using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval and developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch** for classifying handwritten digits, which speaks directly to your need for interns with experience in **data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning**. Furthermore, my project on **hand gesture recognition** utilizing SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite facilitates real-time detection and demonstrates my ability to apply **probabilistic and statistical learning methods** in practical scenarios, bolstering stakeholder and consumer feedback through innovative technology solutions.

My educational background is complemented by my leadership experiences, such as founding and presiding over the “AI Club” at Long Island University, where I fostered a community of over 50 AI enthusiasts. This demonstrates my **strong communication** and **cross-functional collaboration skills**, necessary for working with cross-functional teams at Elevance Health. My ability to learn quickly and apply new knowledge has been honed through participation in various competitions, securing medals in mathematical Olympiads, and winning a People’s Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice, highlighting my prowess in **problem-solving, analytical, and organizational skills**.

I am particularly attracted to this internship because of Elevance Health's commitment to improving healthcare outcomes, equity, and accessibility through a holistic approach—a cause I am deeply passionate about. I am eager to contribute to developing strategies, programs, and solutions that support Elevance Health’s digital strategy, and believe my skills and experiences make me a strong candidate for this role.

I am available to work 40 hours per week throughout the Summer 2024 internship period and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further and will follow up with you next week to potentially schedule an interview. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
