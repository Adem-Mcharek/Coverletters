Hiring Manager  
Workiva  
Ames, Iowa  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Machine Learning Engineering Intern position for the summer of 2024, as advertised on your website. My rigorous academic background in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University Brooklyn, combined with hands-on project experience in machine learning, ideally positions me to make a substantial contribution to Workiva’s mission of powering transparent reporting for a better world.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence with a cumulative GPA of 3.88, where I have honed solid programming skills particularly in Python, the primary programming language for your team. My coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing, coupled with project experience such as the AI Research Assistant role, underscores my solid foundation in the fundamental concepts of machine learning. Particularly, orchestrating a multi-agent AI Research Assistant for real-time academic literature retrieval highlights my capacity to contribute to developing and deploying machine learning models.

Moreover, my project involving the development of a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow demonstrates not only my ability to implement machine learning models but also my understanding of containerization tools akin to Docker, a desired qualification in your posting. This experience, alongside my proficiency in cloud computing and working with cloud platforms, aligns directly with the responsibilities and desirable qualifications cited in the Machine Learning Engineering Intern role.

Beyond my technical skills, I have thrived in leadership and collaborative settings, evidenced by my role as Founder and President of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn. This position has honed my abilities to work within a geographically distributed team, communicate effectively, and organize projects—a skill set that will be beneficial in fulfilling my duties in an Agile development environment at Workiva.

I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my background in AI and machine learning to support Workiva’s development and deployment of machine learning models. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with your team next week to discuss my application further.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Workiva’s innovative projects and am eager to further discuss how I can bring value to your team.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
