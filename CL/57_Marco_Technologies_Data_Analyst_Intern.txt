Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently became aware of the Data Analyst Intern opportunity at Marco Technologies through your company's careers page. With my background in Artificial Intelligence and extensive experience in data analysis, coupled with my education at Long Island University, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

During my undergraduate studies, I have honed my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics, completing projects such as a PyTorch CNN for MNIST and a Computer Vision system using TensorFlow. These projects not only showcase my technical prowess in programming languages like Python, MySQL, and TensorFlow but also underscore my ability to extract, clean, and analyze large datasets to achieve meaningful insights. My role as an AI Research Assistant has further solidified my capabilities in managing data for real-time applications and performing in-depth analysis to guide decision-making processes.

Moreover, my involvement in diverse initiatives, including leading the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn and contributing as a math mentor, has equipped me with strong leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills. These experiences have nurtured my ability to collaborate effectively with stakeholders, understand their needs, and translate complex data into actionable insights, qualities that align with the responsibilities of a Data Analyst Intern at Marco Technologies.

I am eager to bring my expertise in data analysis, project management, and collaborative problem-solving to Marco Technologies, where I can contribute to impactful projects and further your mission of making business technology simple, secure, and better. I am available for a full-time internship during summer 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how my background aligns with the needs of your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further how I can contribute to Marco Technologies.

Warmest regards,

Adem Mcharek
