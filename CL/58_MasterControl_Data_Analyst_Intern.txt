Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I recently came across your job posting on [where you found the job posting] for a [Job Title] position and was thrilled by the opportunity to contribute my expertise in artificial intelligence and my strong programming skills to [Company Name]'s innovative projects. My background in artificial intelligence from Long Island University and hands-on experience with projects and leadership roles make me a strong candidate for this position.

During my time as a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student, I have engaged in various projects that not only sharpened my technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. I have developed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits, achieved competitive results, and engaged in developing a hand gesture recognition system with an 85% recall rate. Another significant project was my involvement as an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn, where I orchestrated a research assistant using AUTOGEN's multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval, showcasing my ability to leverage artificial intelligence for complex problem-solving.

Beyond my technical skills, I have also demonstrated leadership and collaborative skills as the Founder and President of the "AI Club" at LIU Brooklyn, where I managed a community of over 50 AI enthusiasts and spearheaded innovative projects across AI disciplines. My volunteer experience, including founding AJST Zarzis, a scientific club, and mentoring members in math Olympiad concepts, further highlights my ability to lead, mentor, and collaborate effectively.

I am fluent in Arabic, English, and French, and proficient in programming languages such as Python, MySQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more, which I believe will be invaluable in a [specific industry or project focus, if known] context at [Company Name].

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to [Company Nameâ€™s] success and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with your needs. I am available at your convenience for an interview and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you by [specific date, a week from sending the letter] to discuss the possibility of contributing to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to [Company Name].

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
