Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Machine Learning Intern Co-op position for Summer 2024, which I learned about through an Internet search. With Cohere's goal to build machines that understand the world and make them safely accessible to all, I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking AI research and development with one of the leading innovators in the field. As a Computer Science major with a concentration in AI and Machine Learning at [Your University], I am excited about the possibility to apply my academic background and project experience to helping Cohere advance its mission.

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a **proficient understanding of Python and popular ML frameworks** such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, closely aligned with your requirements. Importantly, I have engaged in projects utilizing **large-scale distributed training strategies** and have explored the development of **autoregressive sequence models**, like Transformers, echoing the technical crux of this position. For instance, my project on enhancing NLP techniques for sentiment analysis has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow and experiment with novel model training techniques to push accuracy boundaries further.

Moreover, my role as a research assistant provided me the **experience of working with large datasets** and fostering continual and active learning strategies to refine models based on streaming data. This role honed my **strong communication and problem-solving skills**, as I was tasked with not only developing models but also explaining complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders, allowing for more inclusive decision-making processes.

I am particularly drawn to Cohere's commitment to driving human productivity through safe and responsible AI development. My passion lies in the intersection of machine learning innovations and their practical applications in enhancing business operations and individual daily activities. With my academic background in **GPUs and CUDA programming**, though still burgeoning, I am eager to further develop this through real-world applications and challenges that Cohere offers. 

I am available for a full-time internship from May to August and am flexible with the work location, embracing the remote-first approach. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Cohere's pioneering projects and look forward to the possibility of discussing my application further. I plan to follow up with you in a week to explore the potential for an interview. In the meantime, I am available at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email] for any further information.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my background in machine learning and AI to Cohere and contribute to your team’s innovative work.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
