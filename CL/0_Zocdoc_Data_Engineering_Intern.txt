New York, New York  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I was thrilled to discover the Data Engineering Intern opportunity at Zocdoc through a job listing on LinkedIn. The mission of Zocdoc to empower patients and transform the healthcare experience through technology resonates deeply with my professional aspirations and personal values. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University Brooklyn, where I have honed my skills in **Python, Data Mining, and Machine Learning**—skills that align well with the requirements of this role. 

In my academic projects, I have demonstrated a **strong foundation in computer science fundamentals** and **experience in scripting and programming** for data processing. Notably, my work as an AI Research Assistant led me to orchestrate a multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval using advanced mathematical computations—a testament to my proficiency in Python and my passion for **data engineering**. Additionally, I developed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for **handwritten digit classification**, showcasing my ability to manage and process large **data sets** and implement **data pipelines** in a practical environment.

My role in developing a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow further underlines my capability to work with **big data tools** and implement **data pipelines and architectures** that have tangible impacts. This project, demonstrating an 85% recall rate on a real-time detection system, not only attests to my technical expertise but also to my commitment to creating solutions that address genuine needs.

Beyond technical skills, my journey has instilled in me a keen interest in diving deep into technological challenges, a continuous drive to learn, and a **passion for contributing** to impactful projects. Founding and leading the “AI Club” at Long Island University has honed my **exceptional communication skills** and ability to collaborate, facilitating a vibrant community of over 50 enthusiasts.

I am eager to learn from and contribute to the Zocdoc team, bringing my background in AI and data engineering to the table. I am available to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Zocdoc's needs at your earliest convenience. I plan to follow up next week to inquire about the possibility of discussing my application in more detail. I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Zocdoc’s mission and work alongside dedicated team members who are making meaningful advances in healthcare.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
