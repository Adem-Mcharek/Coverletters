Hiring Manager

Sydney, Australia  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I recently came across the Junior Developer in Consensus Algorithms Intern position advertised on your company's career page. With a strong background in artificial intelligence, Python programming, and an intense enthusiasm for blockchains and decentralized technology, I am excited to apply for this opportunity to contribute to pioneering work in the cloud, data, AI, and Web3 space at Openmesh Networks.

As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student at Long Island University with a Cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00, I have acquired a solid foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering. My practical experience has been further strengthened through projects such as orchestrating an **AI Research Assistant** using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system and developing a **PyTorch CNN** for MNIST handwriting classification. These projects not only honed my **Python, TensorFlow, and Docker** skills but also deepened my understanding of neural networks and artificial intelligence applications.

Beyond my technical capabilities, my role as the **Founder and President of the AI Club** at LIU Brooklyn has allowed me to develop strong leadership and communicative skills. Leading innovative projects across AI disciplines and fostering a vibrant community of AI enthusiasts enabled me to cultivate an environment of teamwork, innovation, and continuous learning. These experiences demonstrate my ability to collaborate effectively with teams and contribute to innovative technological advancements.

I am particularly drawn to this internship at Openmesh Networks because of its commitment to democratizing data and reshaping the landscape of data management through blockchain technology. My keen interest in blockchain and consensus algorithms, combined with my robust programming and problem-solving skills, make me eager to contribute to the development of blockchain consensus algorithms alongside your team.

I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or through email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you next week to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and interests align with the goals of Openmesh Networks.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
