Menlo Park, California  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I came across the Software Engineering Intern Data Platform position at GRAIL on [where you found the listing, e.g., your company website or a career portal]. As a passionate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence with a strong foundation in machine learning, cloud computing, and software engineering, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to GRAIL's mission of early cancer detection.

In my ongoing role as an AI Research Assistant at Long Island University, I have demonstrated the ability to orchestrate complex AI projects using cloud-based technologies. A notable project involved developing an AI-based research assistant utilizing AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, showcasing my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, and experience with cloud computing—a key requirement of the role at GRAIL. Additionally, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow, evidencing my solid grounding in object-oriented programming and my capacity to work efficiently with big data and cloud technologies.

My academic background has solidified my understanding of quantitative fields, with coursework covering Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering. Moreover, I have honed my problem-solving abilities through participating in and winning over 20 victories in national and international math competitions, nurturing a detail-oriented approach to data engineering, from ingestion and transformation to validation and delivery.

I am not only passionate about technical excellence but also about working collaboratively and fostering innovation within a team—a principle that seems to resonate deeply with GRAIL's culture. My experiences leading the AI Club and participating in various hackathons, including securing awards at #hackathon4Justice by the UN and the NASA Space Apps Challenge, have equipped me with exceptional communication and interpersonal skills, making me adept at contributing effectively within a diverse team setting.

I am available to join the GRAIL team in Menlo Park, CA, from June 3rd to August 16th, as per the internship timeline. I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to further discuss my application. I plan to follow up next week to ensure you have received my application and to express my keen interest in this role once again.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to GRAIL's groundbreaking work in cancer detection and care.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
