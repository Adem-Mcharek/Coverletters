Dear Hiring Manager,

I discovered the opportunity for a Data Science Intern at Abelson Taylor through a university career services posting and was immediately drawn to it due to my passion for harnessing data to drive insights in the healthcare sector. With my background as a Bachelor's candidate in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University Brooklyn, and a host of relevant projects and skills directly applicable to this role, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to your esteemed team.

During my academic tenure, I have focused heavily on developing both my theoretical understanding and practical skills in areas critical to data science and AI. I have honed my skills in **machine learning, deep learning, statistics**, and **natural language processing** among others, through both coursework and extensive hands-on projects. Notably, as an **AI Research Assistant**, I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, showcasing my ability to develop and implement complex AI solutions. This project, alongside my development of a **Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch** and a **hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow**, evidences my proficiency with **Python**, and key tools and frameworks mentioned in your job requirements, including **statistics and modeling**.

In addition to my technical prowess, I believe my soft skills further qualify me for the Data Science Intern position. As the **Founder and President of the AI Club** at LIU Brooklyn, I have demonstrated leadership, team collaboration, and an ability to foster a community built around shared passion and curiosity for AI and data science. These experiences have cultivated my abilities to think critically, communicate complex ideas effectively, and work collaboratively in team settingsâ€”skills that are paramount for succeeding in the dynamic environment at Abelson Taylor.

I am particularly excited about the role's emphasis on working closely with the Marketing Intelligence team to develop tools, workflows, and insights. My experience in projects that involve data synthesis, analysis, and application to real-world problems aligns perfectly with the responsibilities described. Additionally, the chance to collaborate on a comprehensive final project, along with the opportunity to learn and contribute to different departments, genuinely excites me.

I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be contacted via my mobile at +1 929-527-4331 or email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I intend to follow up next week to discuss my application further. Thank you for considering my application.
