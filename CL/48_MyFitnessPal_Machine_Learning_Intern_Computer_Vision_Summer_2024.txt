Austin, Texas  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I discovered the exciting opportunity for a Machine Learning Internship specializing in Computer Vision with MyFitnessPal through your company's careers page, and I am enthusiastic about the chance to contribute to empowering users to live healthier lives through technology. With a solid academic background in Artificial Intelligence and hands-on experience in computer vision and deep learning projects, I am confident in my ability to support MyFitnessPal's mission.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, I have excelled in courses related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, maintaining a Cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00. My practical experience, highlighted by projects such as the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for handwriting digit classification and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow, directly aligns with the responsibilities of implementing advanced image recognition and evaluation models at MyFitnessPal.

In addition to my technical abilities, my involvement in founding and leading the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has honed my persuasive and leadership skills, fostering a community of over 50 enthusiasts passionate about AI advancements. This experience has equipped me with the capability to thrive in collaborative environments, a key asset for remote internship roles.

I am excited about the potential to contribute to MyFitnessPal's team, bringing my background in Python, deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, and my familiarity with AWS and Kubernetes to the table. I am available for a remote internship during Summer 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I will follow up next week to discuss my application and look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to MyFitnessPal's vision.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to driving health improvement through advanced food choice tracking technologies at MyFitnessPal.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
