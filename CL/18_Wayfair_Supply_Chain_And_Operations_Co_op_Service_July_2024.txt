Hiring Manager  
Wayfair  
Headquarters Boston, Massachusetts  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I learned of the Supply Chain and Operations Co-op Service position at Wayfair through an online job board, and I am extremely excited to submit my application. My education in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University and my hands-on experience in AI research, computer vision, and data analytics make me a promising candidate to contribute significantly to Wayfair’s Supply Chain and Operations team.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence, I have gained extensive knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, and data mining; skills that are directly relevant to the analytical nature of this role. My academic projects have provided me the opportunity to apply these skills practically. As an AI Research Assistant, I have experience orchestrating multi-agent systems for real-time academic literature retrieval, demonstrating my ability to leverage data to inform strategic initiatives—a key responsibility highlighted in this position. 

Additionally, my project on developing a hand gesture recognition system with an 85% recall rate using TensorFlow further illustrates my capacity for utilizing advanced analytical techniques to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions. As your role demands excellence in analytics with a preference for knowledge in SQL/Google Big Query, R, or Python, I am well-prepared, having applied Python extensively in my projects for data handling and computational tasks.

On the interpersonal front, my role as Founder and President of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has furnished me with the leadership skills necessary to build cross-functional partnerships, crowning me with the ability to work effectively with diverse teams. This experience assures my competence in collaborating with suppliers, carriers, and field teams to drive improvements in operational performance, as crucial for this role.

I am particularly attracted to this position at Wayfair because of the opportunity it provides to be at the forefront of revolutionizing the customer experience through optimizing the supply chain—a passion of mine. The dynamic, challenging environment at Wayfair, combined with its mission to create a feel of home for everyone, resonates deeply with my professional aspirations and my drive to make a tangible impact.

I am available to work the full term from July 8, 2024, to December 20, 2024, in your Boston office and can be contacted at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you by the end of next week to discuss my application. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and learning from the esteemed professionals at Wayfair.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
