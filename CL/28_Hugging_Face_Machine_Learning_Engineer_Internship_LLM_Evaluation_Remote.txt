Notably, my role as an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn entailed developing an AI Research Assistant using AUTOGEN’s multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, demonstrating my understanding of machine learning concepts and experience with evaluating machine learning models. The development and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for handwritten digits classification and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow shows my hands-on experience in handling **datasets** and embodying **front-end technologies**, crucial for the internship role.

**Second Middle Paragraph (Soft Skills):**  
Moreover, my leadership experience as the founder and president of the "AI Club" at LIU Brooklyn, where I nurtured a community of over 50 AI enthusiasts, reflects my strong **communication** and **community interaction skills**. My experience with orchestrating team projects, like the real-time fruit detection web app, showcases my ability to engage and work effectively in large communities of ML professionals and enthusiasts—a key desired qualification for this role.

**Contact Information and Closing:**  
I am available to start this internship as per the company's schedule and eagerly look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further. You can reach me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to ensure you have received my application and to inquire about the possibility of discussing my candidacy in more detail.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Hugging Face's pioneering efforts in the machine learning community and to learn from some of the brightest minds in the industry.

Warm regards,  

Adem Mcharek
