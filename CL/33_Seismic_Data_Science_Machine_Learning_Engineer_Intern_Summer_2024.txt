Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Science/Machine Learning Engineer Intern position for Summer 2024 at Seismic, as advertised on your Careers page. With a strong academic background in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University and hands-on experience in AI and machine learning projects, I am eager to bring my expertise to Seismic's dynamic and innovative team.

My proficiency in **Python libraries**, experience with **ML cloud services**, and understanding of technologies in AI and data science align perfectly with the requirements of the Seismic internship. 

In my role as **AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn**, I spearheaded a project utilizing AUTOGEN's multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval, which mirrors the collaborative and technology-driven environment at Seismic. I also developed a Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch for digit classification and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow, demonstrating my capability to develop, deploy, and optimize models to enable AI capabilities and improve user experience.

My foundational skills are further demonstrated through my achievements, including securing awards in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and leading the AI Club at my university, which showcases my **leadership ability and passion for knowledge sharing**. These experiences have honed my interpersonal skills and my capability to work collaboratively in cross-functional teams, making me an excellent fit for Seismic's culture of continuous guidance and improvement.

I am available for an internship from May to August 2024 and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.
