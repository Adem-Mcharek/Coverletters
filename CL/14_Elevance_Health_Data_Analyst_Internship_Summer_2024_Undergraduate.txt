Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst Internship - Summer 2024 at Elevance Health, which I learned about through your online job posting. With a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and data science from my curriculum at Long Island University, coupled with hands-on project experience, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your team's efforts to reimagine the health system through innovative, data-driven solutions.

Throughout my academic career, I have consistently sought opportunities to apply my coursework in practical settings, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in key analytical technologies and methodologies. For example, as an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn, I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval using advanced AI techniques. Moreover, my projects such as developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow highlight my proficiency in **Python**, **data science**, and **machine learning**, which align perfectly with the technological requisites of this internship.

In addition to my technical prowess, my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and effectively communicate across teams was further demonstrated by founding and leading the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn. This role entailed not only fostering a collaborative learning environment but also coordinating with various stakeholders to execute complex projects successfully. My capability to adapt swiftly to fast-paced environments, strong collaborative skills, and initiative are directly applicable to the dynamic setting at Elevance Health.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills to your team, particularly to assist in developing strategies, programs, and solutions that optimize health outcomes. I am available for the full duration of the Summer 2024 internship and am keen to contribute to the innovative work being done at Elevance Health. Please feel free to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to schedule an interview or discuss my application in further detail. I plan to follow up with you in a week to inquire about the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity further.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and furthering the mission of Elevance Health.

Warm regards,

Adem Mcharek
