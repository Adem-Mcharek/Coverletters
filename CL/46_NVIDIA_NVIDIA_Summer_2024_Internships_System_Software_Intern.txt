Dear NVIDIA Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the System Software Intern position for summer 2024, as advertised on [the platform you found the job on]. My background in Artificial Intelligence, combined with my hands-on project experience and proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C++, and more, aligns closely with the requirements and responsibilities outlined in your job posting. 

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University Brooklyn, I have maintained a Cumulative GPA of 3.88/4.00. My curriculum and projects have deeply involved technologies and skills directly relevant to this internship, including developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch and a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow. These projects not only honed my programming skills but also taught me to apply data structures, algorithms, and the importance of optimizing for power and performance, principles I understand are crucial to the System Software role at NVIDIA.

Furthermore, my role as an AI Research Assistant has equipped me with practical experience in deploying advanced mathematical computations and real-time file retrieval systems. This exposure, complemented by my achievements in various math and programming competitions, underscores my proficiency in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, essential for contributing effectively to NVIDIA's Compiler Software or Graphics Systems Software teams.

On a personal note, I've demonstrated leadership and the ability to drive projects to success as the Founder and President of the "AI Club" at my university, growing its membership to over 50 enthusiasts. This experience illustrates my commitment to collaborative innovation and my capacity to inspire and guide a team toward achieving a common goal.

I am eager to bring my background in artificial intelligence, system software development skills, and passion for technology innovation to NVIDIA. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to NVIDIA's mission of accelerating computing and enhancing technology landscapes across industries.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
