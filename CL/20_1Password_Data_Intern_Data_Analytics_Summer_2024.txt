Dear Hiring Manager,

I was excited to learn about the Data Intern position for Summer 2024 at 1Password through the Internet. As a Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence student, with significant project experience in AI, deep learning, and data processing, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to 1Password’s mission of creating a safer, simpler digital future for everyone.
   
At Long Island University, I dove deeply into the intersection of AI and data analysis, evidenced by projects like the AI Research Assistant for academic literature retrieval and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits. **My work demonstrates an impeccable attention to detail and data quality, aligning with the desired qualifications for this role**. Further, my initiative in founding and presiding over the AI Club showcases my commitment to fostering a community of learning and innovation, reflecting the teamwork and humility 1Password values.

Building a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow and SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite has honed my skills in processing a wide variety of data types and formats—a crucial requirement for the data internship. This project, which achieved an 85% recall rate on a 200-image dataset, also equipped me with the developer workflows and data privacy best practices, underscoring the role’s emphasis on data handling with respect for user privacy.

**Beyond technical prowess**, my ability to think creatively and adapt to new challenges was celebrated through awards like the People's Choice Award at #hackathon4Justice by the UN and securing a place in the NASA Space Apps Challenge. These experiences render me adept at working cross-functionally to understand business objectives and leveraging data to solve complex problems—a key responsibility in this internship.

I am thrilled at the prospect of bringing my data analysis and AI skills to 1Password. Your commitment to a remote-first work environment aligns perfectly with my productivity preferences, allowing for flexibility and optimal work output. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further and explore how I can contribute to the analytics team at 1Password.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
