Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Summer 2024 Data Science Internship position at Western Digital, as advertised on your company website. As a Bachelor student in **Artificial Intelligence** at Long Island University with a **cumulative GPA of 3.88**, my academic and project experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in **Machine Learning, Statistics, Programming (including Python)**, and a passionate drive for data-driven innovation - all of which align with the requirements and desired impact of this role at Western Digital.

Throughout my academic career, I have honed my **data science skills** through hands-on projects and research. Notably, as an **AI Research Assistant** at LIU Brooklyn, I led the development of an AI-driven, multi-agent system for academic literature retrieval leveraging **RAG transformers**. This project exemplifies my proficiency in both **creating practical data science applications** and my understanding of their broader academic and real-world implications. Additionally, I have demonstrated my **problem-solving abilities** and **technical skills** through projects such as the **PyTorch CNN for MNIST**, where my work on **optimizing hyperparameters** led to highly competitive model accuracy, and the **Computer Vision** project utilizing TensorFlow for real-time detection, emphasizing my adeptness in applying **data science techniques** in varied contexts.

With Western Digital’s commitment to innovation and my background in **utilizing machine learning and statistical analysis** to solve complex problems, I am eager to contribute to your team's ongoing projects. I am particularly excited about the possibility of applying my **experience in exploratory data analysis, modeling, and NLP** to support Western Digital’s data and model pipelines development and optimization, as well as generating actionable business insights through data.

I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up with you in a week to discuss how I can contribute to your team. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing my application in further detail and am excited to contribute my part to Western Digital's innovative endeavors.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
