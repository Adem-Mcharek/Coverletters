I recently came across the job posting for [Job Title] on [Where You Found the Job Posting, e.g., LinkedIn].

Furthermore, my leadership as the Founder and President of the "AI Club" at Long Island University exemplifies not only my technical skills but also my capability to inspire and lead teams towards significant advancements in AI research and application.

My soft skills, cultivated through leadership roles and volunteer experiences, include effective communication, leadership, and a strong problem-solving ethos. As the Founder and mentor of AJST Zarzis, a scientific club, I demonstrated my capability to lead by guiding over 100 participants in tech-related projects and preparing members for Math Olympiad competitions, highlighting my dedication to mentorship and community development.

I am available to start working [when you can start], and I am open to discussing how my skills and experiences align with the needs of [Company Name].
