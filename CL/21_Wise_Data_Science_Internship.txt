Hiring Manager  
Wise  
Headquarters: London, United Kingdom  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my earnest interest in the Data Science Internship at Wise, as advertised on your careers page. Wise's mission to create a world with money without borders resonates profoundly with my passion for applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. With my projected graduation in 2025 with a Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University and my hands-on experience in machine learning and data analysis, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Wise's revolutionary goals.

During my academic and research endeavors, I have honed a solid foundation in computer science and machine learning fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, linear algebra, and statistics. Notably, my project as an AI Research Assistant at LIU Brooklyn, where I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, underscores my capability to handle complex data science tasks that align with Wise's technology-driven approach. Moreover, my project on developing a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits and my work on hand gesture recognition using TensorFlow affirm my proficiency in Python and major ML frameworksâ€”a match for the technical skills Wise desires.

Beyond these hard skills, my leadership as the founder and president of the AI Club at LIU Brooklyn has polished my ability to communicate complex, technical concepts to non-technical audiences effectively. This role equips me to fulfill Wise's emphasis on excellent communication skills and the capacity to explain intricate details in an understandable manner. My proactive nature and openness to feedback, evidenced by leading and growing the AI Club's membership, parallel Wise's values of curiosity and continuous improvement.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on real data science projects that matter, using up-to-date machine learning techniques. I am keen to bring my experience in applying machine learning methods to real-world problems, training deep neural networks, and my familiarity with PyTorch and TensorFlow 2 to Wise. Additionally, my eligibility to work in the UK further complements the requirements for this internship.

I am available to start the 10-week internship from June 24th to August 30th, 2024, as specified. Please feel free to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to discuss my application further. I plan to follow up with you in a week to inquire about the possibility of arranging an interview. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Wise's mission and growth.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
