Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the 2024 Summer Machine Learning Engineering Intern position at Workiva, as advertised. As an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, I learned of this exciting opportunity through your company’s career portal. What attracted me most to Workiva is not only your mission to power transparent reporting for a better world but also your commitment to innovation and development in the field of machine learning – values that deeply resonate with both my academic pursuits and career aspirations.

Throughout my academic journey at Long Island University, I have been rigorously trained in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing**, and **Natural Language Processing**, achieving a commendable GPA of 3.88. Beyond the classroom, my practical experiences as an **AI Research Assistant** and involvement in projects like a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation in PyTorch** and development of a **hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow**, have sharpened my programming skills in **Python, PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow**. These projects not only showcased my ability to develop and deploy machine learning models but also my capacity for creative problem-solving and my proficiency in technologies pivotal to this internship role.

Further enhancing my candidacy are my achievements which include securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and my active leadership role as the Founder and President of the "AI Club" at my university. These accolades highlight not only my solid mathematical foundation but also my exceptional **communication, organizational**, and **collaborative skills** – qualities I understand are crucial for succeeding within Workiva's geographically distributed teams. Additionally, my prior experience with **Docker** provides me with a foundational understanding of containerization tools, aligning with the desired qualifications for the role.

I am very much looking forward to the possibility of contributing to Workiva's Research and Development organization, where I can further hone my skills in machine learning model development and deployment, and participate meaningfully in your Agile development methodology. I am certain that my academic background and hands-on project experience make me an excellent match for this position.

Please feel free to contact me at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu to discuss how I can significantly contribute to Workiva. I plan to follow up with you in a week to explore the possibility of discussing my application in greater detail.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with Workiva and contribute to your team's success.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
