Hiring Manager  
Dow Jones  
New York, New York

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Summer 2024 Data Analyst Internship at Dow Jones, a position I learned about through an online portal. My background in Artificial Intelligence, combined with a passionate involvement in data analysis projects and achievements in computational competitions, uniquely positions me to contribute significantly to your team.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University, I have excelled in courses like Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Data Mining which afforded me a solid foundation in data analysis. My role as an AI Research Assistant has honed my skills in managing large datasets and applying analytical methods to derive meaningful insights, closely aligning with the responsibilities outlined for this internship.

My project work, including the development of a CNN for digit recognition and a computer vision system for gesture recognition, demonstrates my capability in manipulating and interpreting complex data sets. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical abilities in Python and SQL but also my ability to leverage tools like TensorFlow for effective data analysis - skills essential for the responsibilities listed in your internship.

Moreover, my involvement in competitive platforms, securing medals in the International Youth Mathematical Olympiad and a People’s Choice Award at the UN #hackathon4Justice, underscores my talent for problem-solving and innovation under pressure. My leadership role as the founder of the "AI Club" at LIU Brooklyn highlights my drive to foster communities that are passionate about data and AI technologies.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at Dow Jones due to its commitment to harnessing technology in delivering impactful business and financial insights. I am eager to bring my analytical prowess, along with my enthusiasm for data-driven problem solving, to contribute to your projects of data insights, engineering, and transformation strategy.

I am available to work during the specified internship period and am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further. I plan to follow up with you in a week to possibly arrange an interview. In the meantime, I can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to the Dow Jones Data Insights & Solutions teams and learning from the esteemed professionals at your organization.

Warm regards,

Adem Mcharek
