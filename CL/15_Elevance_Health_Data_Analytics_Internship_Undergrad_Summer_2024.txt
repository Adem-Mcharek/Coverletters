Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analytics Internship - Undergrad, Summer 2024 position at Elevance Health, which I learned about through the company’s job posting on the Internet. With my educational background in Artificial Intelligence from Long Island University Brooklyn, my dynamic experience in AI research and data analytics, and my passion for leveraging technological solutions in healthcare, I am keen to contribute to Elevance Health’s mission of reimagining the health system through analytics-driven insights and innovation.

During my tenure at Long Island University Brooklyn, I have engaged in multiple projects that underscore my capability and enthusiasm for addressing complex data challenges. Notably, as an AI Research Assistant, I orchestrated a multi-agent system for real-time academic literature retrieval, demonstrating my aptitude for handling large-scale datasets and crafting impactful solutions. Furthermore, my project on developing a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow and facilitating a web app for real-time fruit detection highlights my proficiency in utilizing data processing tools for accuracy and practical utility.

My achievements extend beyond academia; I have triumphed in securing medals in International Math Olympiads, a reflection of my excellent problem-solving and analytical skills. These experiences, coupled with my solid foundation in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other programming languages, align well with the responsibilities and desired qualifications listed for the Data Analytics Internship.

In addition to my technical skills, I have demonstrated leadership as the founder and president of the AI Club at Long Island University, where I have spearheaded innovative projects and fostered a vibrant community of AI enthusiasts. This experience attests to my ability to collaborate effectively with team members and my strong intellectual curiosity and motivation for continuous learning and improvement.

I am eager to bring my blend of skills, experience, and passion for healthcare and analytics to the Data Analytics Intern - Undergrad, Summer 2024 position at Elevance Health. I am available to start the internship in May 2024, as per the program schedule, and am flexible to work in a hybrid setting from the Massachusetts offices. I will follow up with you in a week to discuss my application further and am reachable at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Elevance Health’s goals and to further discuss how I can add value to your team.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
