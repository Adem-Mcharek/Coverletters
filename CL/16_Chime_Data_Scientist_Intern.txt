Hiring Manager  
Chime  
San Francisco, California

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Data Scientist Intern position at Chime, as advertised on [source of job post, e.g., your careers page]. With a robust foundation in artificial intelligence, as I pursue my Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence at Long Island University, coupled with hands-on experience in developing advanced ML models and a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, I am eager to contribute to Chime's mission of making financial peace of mind a reality for everyone.

During my academic projects and research assistantship at LIU Brooklyn, I have honed my skills in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud computing, all of which are crucial for developing cutting-edge machine learning and feature engineering systems. My project on developing a hand gesture recognition system using TensorFlow and a real-time fruit detection web app showcased my ability to design, train, and deploy innovative ML models. This experience directly aligns with the responsibilities of assisting in the design and deployment of ML models at Chime【9†source】.

Furthermore, my engagement as the Founder and President of the “AI Club” and my active participation in mathematical Olympiads have sharpened my soft skills, including teamwork, effective communication, and the ability to collaborate with individuals of diverse technical backgrounds. These experiences have instilled in me a strong sense of community and the importance of sharing knowledge and learning from others, which I understand is highly valued at Chime【9†source】【11†source】.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn from and contribute to the Data Science and Platform (DSP) team, driving broad impact across Chime's customer touchpoints through innovative ML solutions. My background in AI, proficiency in Python and ML toolkits, and my enthusiasm for creating real-world solutions make me a well-suited candidate for this role.

I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at +1 929-527-4331 or via email at adem.mcharek@my.liu.edu. I plan to follow up next week to discuss how I can contribute to the team at Chime, but please feel free to contact me if you need any further information or documentation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application in more detail and explore how I can contribute to achieving Chime’s mission.

Sincerely,

Adem Mcharek
